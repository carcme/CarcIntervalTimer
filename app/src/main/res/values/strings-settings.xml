<p>This timer is the result of many searches to find an interval timer with certain features. None of the other times had all the features I wanted
or were too complex and did too much! So I decided to create my own and use it to learn a bit more about Android along the way.</p>
<p>If you have any features you\'d like to see, let me know via the feedback button</p>
